    <h2>Delta Five</h2><h4 class="date">2014-2016</h4>
  </div>
  <p>Here, I worked on a small team to develop an IoT monitoring device from 
  scratch. I was chiefly responsible for the circuit design, PCB layout, and electronics 
  manufacturing for both enterprise and consumer end users. In addition, I designed, 
  developed, and continued to maintain the product firmware, squashing bugs as soon
  as they were discovered. By the time I left Delta Five, our devices were being beta 
  tested by 7 operating businesses.
  </p>
  <p>In addition to our standard product focus, I performed several rapid prototypes
  for proof-of-principle validation, as well as designed a power supply
  <span id="and">&</span> computer system for a prototype mobile robot.
  </p>
  <p>Other duties included acting as the face of customer service 
  for our beta testing program, co-designing the interface for our web 
  dashboard, and maintaining/validating functionality through constant design
  iterations.

  <p>Working here during my senior year at NC State, I focused on the development 
  of a rechargeable power supply for a luminescent hoodie. I also developed 
  prototypes of a rechargeable illuminated streetwear hat. Neither ever made 
  it to production, but it was an important experience in learning development 
  and prototyping skills. Electric MVMT also was a sponsor for my 
  <a href="projects.html#outerwear">capstone project</a>, where I worked with
  a small team to develop a prototype for another emerging product.

    <h2>North Carolina State University</h2><h4 class="date">2010-2014</h4>

  <p>I was formally introduced to C and Java, as well as
  controls, microprocessor optimization, and a full spectrum of circuit analysis. 
  I built several cool projects and a slew of boring ones. 
  </p>
  <p>Through a variety of group projects, I developed team leadership skills 
  and won a few awards. I'm most proud of being elected <span class="italics">
  Outstanding Senior Design Student</span> (see 
  <a href="projects.html#outerwear">capstone project</a>)
  from a class of 60+ students by both instructors, independently.

  <p>I traveled to Germany to work on security systems for European clients. Most of the
  internship focused on analyzing shipping data for cost savings and using 
  AutoCAD to organize and maintain security installation documentation.</p>

  <p>It was my first internship, so I can't say I did anything too impressive.
    I built my first GUI to support database interactions, and I supported
    the senior engineers with soldering <span id="and">&</span> board validation.
